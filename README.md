# ðŸ“˜ PDF-RAG System

A **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system that allows users to upload PDF documents and ask questions about their content. The system processes PDFs, extracts meaningful chunks, embeds them into a vector database, and uses an LLM to provide context-aware answers.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

-   **User Authentication**  
    Integrated with **Clerk Auth** for secure login and signup.

-   **PDF Upload**  
    Users can upload PDFs, which are stored and queued for background processing.

-   **Background Processing with Queue**  
    Using **BullMQ** workers, PDFs are processed asynchronously to extract and chunk content.

-   **Vector Embeddings**  
    Extracted chunks are embedded using **LangChain** and stored in a **Vector Database (Qdrant)**.

-   **Intelligent Querying**  
    User queries are converted into embeddings, matched with the most relevant chunks, and combined with context for accurate responses.

-   **Frontend Experience**  
    Built with **Next.js**, providing an intuitive interface for uploading documents and chatting with the system.

-   **Backend Processing**  
    Powered by **Express.js** to handle uploads, manage workers, and communicate with the vector database.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

-   **Frontend:** Next.js (React-based UI for PDF upload & chat interface)
-   **Backend:** Express.js (API routes, file handling, communication with workers)
-   **Queue:** BullMQ (background job handling for PDF processing)
-   **Auth:** Clerk (user authentication and session management)
-   **Embeddings & Orchestration:** LangChain
-   **Vector Database:** Qdrant (stores PDF embeddings for semantic search)

## ðŸ”„ System Workflow

1. **Authentication:** User logs in/signup using Clerk.
2. **Upload:** User uploads a PDF document via the frontend.
3. **Storage & Queue:** The PDF is stored, and a job is pushed to a **BullMQ** queue.
4. **Worker:** A background worker processes the PDF, chunks text, and generates embeddings.
5. **Vector Store:** Embeddings are stored in **Qdrant** for retrieval.
6. **Query:** User types a question â†’ converted into embeddings.
7. **Retrieval:** Relevant chunks are retrieved from Qdrant.
8. **LLM Response:** Context + Query passed to an LLM â†’ response returned to the user.
